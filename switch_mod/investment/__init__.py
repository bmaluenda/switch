This package adds generation project and transmission line construction.

The core module in the package is proj_build. The proj_discrete_build module 
is optional and enforces discrete unit builds (see that module for 
documentation).

If transmission wants to be included in the model, then the 
investment.trans_build module should be loaded. If this is the case,
operations.trans_dispatch must also be included.

This package can be treated as a module that includes all of the mentioned 
core modules instead of having to refer to them individually. This means that
the module list can be specified as:

switch_modules = (
    'timescales', 'financials', 'load_zones', 'fuels', 'gen_tech',
    'investment')

or as

switch_modules = (
    'timescales', 'financials', 'load_zones', 'fuels', 'gen_tech',
    'investment.proj_build')

You will get an error if you include both the package and the core modules,
because they are redundant.
