This package adds operational decisions and constraints both on projects and
on transmission lines.

The core module in the package is proj_dispatch. The no_commit module can be 
included to define simple operational bounds. Alternatively, a unit commitment 
formulation can be considered by including the unitcommit package. The 
no_commit module and the unitcommit package are mutually exclusive.

If transmission wants to be included in the model, then the 
operations.trans_dispatch module should be loaded. If this is the case,
investment.trans_build must also be included.

This package can be treated as a module that includes all of the mentioned 
core modules instead of having to refer to them individually. This means that
the module list can be specified as:

switch_modules = (
    'timescales', 'financials', 'load_zones', 'fuels', 'operations')

or as

switch_modules = (
    'timescales', 'financials', 'load_zones', 'fuels',
    'operations.proj_dispatch')

You will get an error if you include both the package and the core modules,
because they are redundant.
