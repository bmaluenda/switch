    STORAGE_TECH is a subset of GENERATION_TECHNOLOGIES that can
    store electricity for later discharge. Members of this set can
    be abbreviated as storage or s.

    g_storage_efficiency[STORAGE_TECH] describes the round trip
    efficiency of a storage technology. A storage technology that is 75
    percent efficient would have a storage_efficiency of .75. If 1 MWh
    was stored in such a storage project, 750 kWh would be available for
    extraction later. Internal leakage or energy dissipation of storage
    technologies is assumed to be neglible, which is consistent with
    short-duration storage technologies currently on the market which
    tend to consume stored power within 1 day. If a given storage
    technology has significant internal discharge when it stores power
    for extended time perios, then those behaviors will need to be
    modeled in more detail.

    g_store_to_release_ratio[STORAGE_TECH] describes the maximum rate
    that energy can be stored, expressed as a ratio of discharge power
    capacity. This is an optional parameter and will default to 1. If a
    storage project has 1 MW of dischage capacity and a max_store_rate
    of 1.2, then it can consume up to 1.2 MW of power while charging.

    g_storage_energy_overnight_cost[storage, period] is the overnight
    capital cost per MWh of energy capacity for building the given
    storage technology installed in the given investment period. This is
    only defined for storage technologies. Note that this describes the
    energy component and the overnight_cost describes the power
    component.
    
    The previous three parameters provide default values for projects
    that implement that technology. These parameters may be overridden
    on a project-specific basis via proj_storage_efficiency[STORAGE_PROJECTS],
    proj_store_to_release_ratio[STORAGE_PROJECTS], and
    proj_storage_energy_overnight_cost[(proj, bld_yr) in STORAGE_PROJECT_BUILDYEARS]

    STORAGE_PROJECTS is the set of projects that use storage technologies.

    STORAGE_PROJECT_BUILDYEARS is the subset of PROJECT_BUILDYEARS, restricted
    to storage projects.

    BuildStorageEnergyMWh[(proj, bld_yr) in STORAGE_PROJECT_BUILDYEARS]
    is a decision of how much energy capacity to build onto a storage
    project. This is analogous to BuildProj, but for energy rather than power.
    
    Total_Storage_Energy_Install_Costs_Annual[PERIODS] is an expression of the
    annual costs incurred by the BuildStorageEnergyMWh decision.
    
    StorageEnergyCapacity[proj, period] is an expression describing the
    cumulative available energy capacity of BuildStorageEnergyMWh. This is
    analogous to ProjCapacity.
    
    STORAGE_PROJ_DISPATCH_POINTS is the subset of PROJ_DISPATCH_POINTS,
    restricted to storage projects.

    ChargeStorage[(proj, t) in STORAGE_PROJ_DISPATCH_POINTS] is a dispatch
    decision of how much to charge a storage project in each timepoint.
    
    LZ_NetCharge[LOAD_ZONE, TIMEPOINT] is an expression describing the
    aggregate impact of ChargeStorage in each load zone and timepoint.
    
    Charge_Storage_Upper_Limit[(proj, t) in STORAGE_PROJ_DISPATCH_POINTS]
    constrains ChargeStorage to available power capacity (accounting for
    proj_store_to_release_ratio)
    
    StateOfChargeMWh[(proj, t) in STORAGE_PROJ_DISPATCH_POINTS] is a variable
    for tracking state of charge. This value stores the state of charge at
    the end of each timepoint for each storage project.
    
    Track_State_Of_Charge[(proj, t) in STORAGE_PROJ_DISPATCH_POINTS] constrains
    StateOfChargeMWh based on the StateOfChargeMWh in the previous timepoint,
    ChargeStorage and DispatchProj.
    
    State_Of_Charge_Upper_Limit[(proj, t) in STORAGE_PROJ_DISPATCH_POINTS]
    constrains StateOfChargeMWh based on installed energy capacity.
